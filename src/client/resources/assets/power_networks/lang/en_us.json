You can find example on the mods github page under src/main/resources/head_textures. \n\nTo create a new texture you need to create a new skin where the head has the texture of the coil, both layers are used. Then you set it as your minecraft skin and obtain you own head. \n\nYou can get the value from the head by inspecting it's nbt or copying it from the give command. Afterwards you can switch back to your previous skin, mojang stores all previously uploaded skins.",
